# CAiSE-21 paper: Mining User Feedback For Software Engineering: Use Cases and Reference Architecture

The repository contains suplementary materialas for the paper. They are parts of the submission for CAiSE'21. The materials include:

- data items collected from 149 primary studies analyzing app reviews for software engineering; mapping between app review analyses (a.k.a. services) and data mining techniques ("data-items-and-mapping.xlsx")
- models showing how developers could make use of app review mininig to support software engieering tasks ("se-models.pdf")
- matrices mapping (i) software engineering tasks and app review analyses; (ii) review mining use cases and app review analyses; and (iii) software enginering tasks and review mining use cases ("use-case-architecture-synthesis.xlsx")

Do not duplicate the materials nor distribute them without authors' permission. 

We hope our novel reference architecture and app review mining use cases described in the paper will contribute to improving the quality of software engineering.
