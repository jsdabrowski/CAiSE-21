# CAiSE-21 paper: Mining User Feedback For Software Engineering: Use Cases and Reference Architecture

The repository contains suplementary materialas for the paper. They are parts of the submission for CAiSE'21. The materials include:

- models showing how developers could support software engieering tasks by mining app reviews.
- mapping between app review analysis (a.k.a. services) and data mining techniques.

Do not duplicate the materials nor distribute them without authors' permission. 

We hope our novel reference architecture and app review mining use cases described in the paper will contribute to improving the quality of software engineering.
